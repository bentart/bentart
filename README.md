- 👋 Hi, I’m Arthur Bent. I'm Haitian and was raised in Sunny South Florida.  I graduated from the University of Notre Dame and have worked in tech for nearly 6 years.
  I've worked as a Support Engineer in JP Morgan for nearly 3 years. While working at JP Morgan I worked on a global team(Singapore, India, UK, US) to support 15+ apps that would perform various functions such as Liquidity Sweeps,
  International balance transfer, providing investment reports and more.  In my everyday work, I used Python, Linux/Unix, SQL, and more to release new codes for these apps, create automation for manual work, and support our
  internal and external teams.
